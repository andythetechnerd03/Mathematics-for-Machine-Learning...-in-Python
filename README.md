# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning...-in-Python

These are codes from the Mathematics for Machine Learning Book from Cambridge University Press that apply the important theories in practice. </br>
I try to make the code as readable as possible and apply some input techniques from Competitive Programming to the codes here. </br>
Have fun reading, please credit my work if you happen to use it and distribute it.
